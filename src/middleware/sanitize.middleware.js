/**
 * Express-5-safe replacement for `express-mongo-sanitize`.
 *
 * Why this file exists: express-mongo-sanitize REASSIGNS req.query, but in
 * Express 5 req.query is a getter-only property. That throws
 * "Cannot set property query of #<IncomingMessage> which has only a getter"
 * and turns every request carrying a query string into a 500.
 *
 * The fix is to strip dangerous keys IN PLACE — mutating the object's own
 * properties is allowed, only rebinding req.query is not.
 *
 * We remove keys starting with '$' (Mongo operators like $gt, $where) and keys
 * containing '.' (dotted-path injection), which is what the original package
 * guards against.
